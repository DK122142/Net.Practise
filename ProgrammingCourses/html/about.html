                        We are all very different. We were born in different cities, at different times, we love different music, food, movies. But we have something that unites us all. It is our company. We are its heart. We are not just a team, we are a family.

                        Class Central is a listing of online courses. We aggregate courses from many providers to make it easy to find the best courses on almost any subject, wherever they exist. We focus primarily on free (or free to audit) courses from universities, offered through massive open online course (MOOC) platforms. Whatever you are interested in learning, it is more than likely that our catalog includes a course that will meet your needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through Class Central, you can find courses; review courses you’ve taken (and read other people’s reviews); follow universities, subjects and courses to receive personalized updates; and also plan and track your learning.

                        Class Central is a remote company with no physical offices. Our team consists of learners whose lives have been impacted by online education. Between us, we have done almost 300 online courses and 3 online degrees (including one self-directed degree equivalent). If our names look familiar, it may be because you have read articles we have written or even because one of us has been a mentor in a course you took.

                    <p>
                        Our goal is to make online education work for everyone, so we’re constantly working on new features. If you have an idea for how to make Class Central more useful, please let us know.
